## Getting started

1. Build your library
  * Run `yarn install` (recommended) or `npm install` to get the project's dependencies
  * Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to produce minified version of your library.
2. Development mode
  * Having all the dependencies installed run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. This command will generate an non-minified version of your library and will run a watcher so you get the compilation on file change.
3. Running the tests
  * Run `yarn test` or `npm run test`

## Scripts

* `yarn build` or `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `lib` folder
* `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `yarn test` or `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `yarn test:watch` or `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode
